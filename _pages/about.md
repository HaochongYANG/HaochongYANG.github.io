My name is Haochong, but you can also call me by my preferred name Rogers for simplicity. 

I'm currently pursuing an Honours Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Computer Science at the University of Toronto. My research experience spans multiple cutting-edge projects, including enhancing machine learning models for mental health prediction and exploring the quantitative classification of single cells DNA data.

In the industry, I've applied my expertise as a Data Analyst at Toromont CAT, developing a company chatbot and optimizing asset management platforms, and as a Software Developer at BL Innovare, enhancing machine learning applications for vehicle inspection.

I'm excited to share my journey, projects, and insights with you through this platform. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts and professionals in the field!
