<p><strong>Description:</strong> This research focuses on the heterogeneity of single-cell Hi-C DNA data to explore the quantitative methods for classifying different types of single cells based on DNA Hi-C data and contact matrices. Large amount of data cleaning and transformation is performed on the original dataset, different methods of dimension reduction are applied, including Principle Component Analysis, t-SNE, UMAP, with clustering techniques such as K-Means performed on lower dimension representations.</p>

<h1>Multi-agent LLM for Mental Health Diagnosis</h1>
<p><strong>April 2024 - August 2024, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada</strong></p>

<img src="../images/llm.png" alt="Single Cell Hi-C" align="left" style="width: 200px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;" />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This project involves the development of a multi-agent framework using LLMs to simulate a therapist's role in mental health diagnosis. The goal is to establish a framework that can mimic a therapist by interacting with users and analyzing responses to provide insights into their mental health. My contributions to this project included working on both the backend and frontend development, as well as the prompt engineering for the models. I also conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the models and the overall system.</p>

<h1>Real-Life Data Modeling with the Modified Burr III Odds Ratio–G Distribution</h1>
<p><strong>September 2023 – May 2024, University of West Florida, Pensacola, USA</strong></p>

<img src="path_to_image" alt="BurrIII" align="left" style="width: 200px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;" />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This research introduces the modified Burr III Odds Ratio–G distribution, a novel statistical model that integrates the odds ratio concept with the foundational Burr III distribution. The study focuses on a key subclass within this innovative framework, designated as the Burr III Scaled Inverse Odds Ratio–G (B-SIOR-G) distribution. By effectively combining the odds ratio with the Burr III distribution, this model enhances both flexibility and predictive accuracy. The paper delves into the mathematical and statistical properties of this distribution family, including hazard rate functions, quantile functions, moments, and more. Through rigorous simulations, the robustness of the B-SIOR-G model is affirmed. The model's flexibility and practicality are demonstrated through its application to four datasets, showcasing its superior efficacy over several well-established distributions.</p>
