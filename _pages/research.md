# Real-Life Data Modeling with the Modified Burr III Odds Ratio–G Distribution
**September 2023 – May 2024, University of West Florida, Pensacola, USA**

![BurrIII](path_to_image)

*Description:* This research introduces the modified Burr III Odds Ratio–G distribution, a novel statistical model that integrates the odds ratio concept with the foundational Burr III distribution. The study focuses on a key subclass within this innovative framework, designated as the Burr III Scaled Inverse Odds Ratio–G (B-SIOR-G) distribution. By effectively combining the odds ratio with the Burr III distribution, this model enhances both flexibility and predictive accuracy. The paper delves into the mathematical and statistical properties of this distribution family, including hazard rate functions, quantile functions, moments, and more. Through rigorous simulations, the robustness of the B-SIOR-G model is affirmed. The model's flexibility and practicality are demonstrated through its application to four datasets, showcasing its superior efficacy over several well-established distributions.
