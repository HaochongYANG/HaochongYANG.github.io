<img src="../images/singlecell1.png" alt="Single Cell Hi-C" align="left" style="width: 200px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;" />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This research focuses on the heterogeneity of single-cell Hi-C DNA data to explore the quantitative methods for classifying different types of single cells based on DNA Hi-C data and contact matrices. Large amount of data cleaning and transformation is performed on the original dataset, different methods of dimension reduction are applied, including Principle Component Analysis, t-SNE, UMAP, with clustering techniques such as K-Means performed on lower dimension representations.</p>

<h1>Multi-agent LLM for Mental Health Diagnosis</h1>
<p><strong>April 2024 - August 2024, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada</strong></p>

<img src="../images/llm.png" alt="llm" align="left" style="width: 200px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;" />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This project involves the development of a multi-agent framework using LLMs to simulate a therapist's role in mental health diagnosis. The goal is to establish a framework that can mimic a therapist by interacting with users and analyzing responses to provide insights into their mental health. My contributions to this project included working on both the backend and frontend development, as well as the prompt engineering for the models. I also conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the models and the overall system.</p>

<img src="../images/shap_summary.png" alt="shap" align="left" style="width: 200px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;" />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This research introduces a novel approach for efficiently predicting multi-class anxiety levels through a machine learning framework designed to handle long assessments. We developed a model that effectively shortens traditional lengthy assessments while maintaining high accuracy in predicting anxiety levels. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance through rigorous simulations and validation, highlighting its potential for practical application in clinical and research settings. This study underscores the importance of integrating sophisticated machine learning models to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of mental health assessments.</p>

<h1>Leaky Emotion in Social Psychology by Reinforcement Learning</h1>
<p><strong>September 2023 – May 2024, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada</strong></p>

<img src="../images/gem.png" alt="Gem" align="left" style="width: 200px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;" />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This project explores the impact of personal emotions on the behavior of other agents in a social setting using a reinforcement learning framework. The study employs a gaming environment where agents communicate and share information about the location of wolves to avoid predation. By fine-tuning the reinforcement learning environment and leveraging machine learning techniques, the research aims to demonstrate how leaked emotions through communication can enhance mutual benefit among agents. Key tasks included designing visualizations for the training process, optimizing game logic, and conducting statistical analysis on game data to validate various social cognition theories.</p>

<h1>Real-Life Data Modeling with the Modified Burr III Odds Ratio–G Distribution</h1>
<p><strong>September 2023 – May 2024, University of West Florida, Pensacola, USA</strong></p>

<img src="../images/burrIII.png" alt="BurrIII" align="left" style="width: 200px; height: auto; margin-right: 20px;" />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This research presents the modified Burr III Odds Ratio–G distribution, a novel model that integrates the odds ratio with the Burr III distribution. Focusing on the Burr III Scaled Inverse Odds Ratio–G subclass, this model enhances flexibility and predictive accuracy. The study explores the mathematical properties of the distribution, including hazard rates, quantiles, and moments by proofs. Rigorous simulations confirm the robustness of the model, and its application to four datasets demonstrates its efficacy compared to established distributions.</p>
