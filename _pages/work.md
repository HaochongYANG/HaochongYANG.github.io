    <p> During my co-op at Toromont CAT, I trained a large language model with documentation and system data using LangChain and OpenAI API to develop a company chatbot, “CatGPT”, which will benefit over 2000 users seeking business solutions. I optimized the Strategic Asset Management platform through the implementation of Power BI and Python, enabling real-time monitoring and efficient tracking of heavy mining machinery status and operational activities. Additionally, I created a predictive model with Matplotlib to track machine usage patterns and forecast component replacements. My collaboration with 16 Canadian mine owners to update machine component statuses resulted in a significant reduction of $57 million in overdue value.</p>

    <p> As a Software Developer intern at BL Innovare, I spearheaded daily data analysis, software development, and support operations for a leading company specializing in vehicle inspection and maintenance products and services. I enhanced the performance of Bodyguard 2.0, an advanced machine learning application designed to simulate human perceptual and decision-making processes for vehicle inspection and damage analysis. My contributions also included the back-end development of a language translating platform using Python and the Django framework. Additionally, I demonstrated proficiency in crafting intricate SQL queries to process customer data and conduct in-depth data analysis.</p>
